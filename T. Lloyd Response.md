In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors discuss other viable options of graphing and depicting human populations through the uses of satellites and other geospatial data layers. These methods create a more precise and dynamic image of mapping where peoples are located all over the world without the need for a pricy national census. One of the datasets used is the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) which combines the data of large surveys, like the census, and urban extents mapped from satellites. As explained in the article, these gridded populations distributions ultimately disaggregate the data more accurately than past methodologies, especially when incorporating multiple spatial datasets. Their method is an improvement of past techniques because the data being produced is more exact and uses less manpower and resources compared to a conventional census.
