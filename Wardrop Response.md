The top-down method utilizes recent census data and digital boundary data to form maps of huge data sets, like the national census or larger surveys. Just like the top-down method, the bottom-up process shares the same goal of producing estimates of the population for small sectors, or high spatial-resolution grids. Alternatively, bottom-up processing takes data from small, defined areas rather than disaggregating the full national census. Then, statistical models that can predict the outcome of other uncharted regions. 
In the article, it’s stated that the top-down method’s greatest challenge is determining the reliability of input population data since many countries have not updated their census since the mid to late 1900s. Being able to conduct the census itself is a strenuous task that requires a lot of human capacity, resources, and technology. On the other hand, the bottom-up method “benefits from advances in geospatial data used in the top-down models”. The way I interpret it is that the bottom-up process fills in the data for countries that are not able to provide the numbers of large scale surveys since the bottom-up method is able to predict populations where the statistics are present for small subsets of the area or even nonsampled areas. Some advantages of the bottom-up approach are hat uncertainty about population estimates can be explicitly quantified, and that it is less costly for countries. One commonality that both top-down and bottom-up methods have is the potential to improve their spatial accuracy because of novel data sources such as social media and mobile communications.
