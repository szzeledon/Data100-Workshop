Question 1.

The authors in this article describe the use of the technique named “Random Forest” estimation. The way that it works is by combining remotely-sensed and geospatial data that produce a gridded possibly outcome of a population density at ~100 m spatial resolution. That layer is then reused by countries to contribute to the dasymetric redistribution of the census counts. 

Question 2. 

The machine learning method algorithm, or the ensemble method, contains a multitude of individual classifications that grow and predict based upon other points of data, such as a tree would do. This method is attractive because its output can be used to guess post-hoc variable importance measures. The clear distinction between these two models is that the machine learning method has the ability to analyze the data, and further predict future results whereas classical statistical approaches, like the census, must be recounted manually. 

Question 3.

The process begins with aggregating census data into a singular administrative unit up. Once that unit is analyzed, there is a 10km buffered covariate boundary placed, and then the vector-based covariate data by buffered census boundary is extracted. This essentially slowly layers data to formulate a dasymetric map estimated by the “Random Forest” model. The size of this data set in general is approximately 100 meter by 100 meter pixels. Big data used in the machine learning method is a fundamental aspect of estimating the human population distribution because it is the starting point for predicting the future densities. 

Question 4. 

The two authors explain that the new “Random Forest” estimation would provide nations with information on how populations fluxes impact policy and planning nationwide initiative. The highly accurate data would allow governments to be able to provide for their population faster and with more precision, even taking the future populations into consideration. 

Question 5. 

I chose Azerbaijan as my LMIC, and with the use of a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located would ensure the exact location where large communities are spread out in different parts of the country, and then target that particular area in terms of aid. Specifically to Azerbaijan, a large portion of the population density resides in the region near the capital, and it makes it harder for those living in more rural communities to get the same recognition because they pose almost no impact. With a more accurate method, these smaller towns could also be noted in data sets.
