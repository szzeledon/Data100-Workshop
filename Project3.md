The total population of Barda, Azerbaijan is 154812 and the total number of urban areas is 17 religions. The main city is Barda City and is located in the center of the region. The plot above has primary and secondary roads with the only nearest healthcare facility of the boundary. I downloaded the data from HDX Data which provided me with the roads from OpenStreetMap Export. The primary roads are in blue and the secondary in green. The most crossroads are in the center of Barda city. The lower half of the area is majority empty with no major urban areas or any major roads that pass through either. For the health care facilities,  I also imported data from HDX, but there was only one observation for the district of Barda. I tried other sources to see if there were more, but I would either end with the same result or even zero. With one quick google search, it was easy to find that there were more health care facilities within the area and even the city itself. The one hospital is identified by a magenta cross.
