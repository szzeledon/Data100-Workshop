## Part 1: Acquiring, Modifying and Describing the Data

The histogram plots listed above depict the population density in Azerbaijan in 2019.

The residual model above contains variables pop19 and night time lights. The data is very concentrated in one area of the graph which is most likely an indicator of an urban sector.

This residual model contains night time lights, urban cover, and bare cover as independent variables and pop19 as the dependent variable. 

## Part 2: Modeling & Predicting Spatial Values

The plot above is a basic map showing the density of the population in Azerbaijan which is located near the capital city of Baku on the coast. 

### Investigating Margins of Error

This first plot shows the magnitude and direction of error from the predicted values. The histogram shows that the majority of the country has either no error or is very close to zero. However, there are some higher levels of error around the capital city.

I subsetted the city of Baku to get a more detailed scale and to get a closer look at the marginal error.

Finally, I overlayed a city map of Baku on the difference plot.

I encountered many difficulties while constructing these plots, and it’s fair to say it took me much longer than one would have hoped for. I’ll cherish the late nights of deciphering lines of code with only the scorching heat of my MacBook keeping me awake. Being new to all this material, I had many triumphs when I was able to resolve an issue all on my lonesome. Yet, without the help of professor Fraizer, I truly would be lost. Typically, my plan of attack looked like this: follow along on Prof. Fraizer’s marvelous website, get stuck, step away for a moment to think, try again, try something different, panic, write out a cry for help on slack, and before I would press send, I would try one more time. It was usually a 50/50 on whether I was able to get it or not, but I digress. Through this, I learned how to predict spatial values across the landscape of Azerbaijan and also the margin of error for that prediction.  Beyond that, I learned the meaning of persistence.
