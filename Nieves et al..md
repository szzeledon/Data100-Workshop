Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict the population distributions in primarily low- and middle-income countries. The random forest model is explained in the Stevens et al. article in three simple steps that Nieves et al. uses in their methodology. First, selecting covariates repeatedly for the RF model. Then, implementing the model with the already available census data to produce a population density weighting layer from the created RF model. Finally, a plot that redistributes the population count and converts it to grid cells along with the population density weighting layer. Essentially, census data is aggregated methodically through a machine to more accurately predict the population. A dasymetric population allocation is a geographic plot that predicts the population distribution of a country and shows which regions are denser than others. As described in the article, the geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting where humans reside depending on the geography, relation to infrastructure and urban areas, and points of interest.
