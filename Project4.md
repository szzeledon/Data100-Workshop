### How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of urban areas?
The Barda district is a flat valley-like area that has a total population of around 155,000 where only around 23,000 live in the main city. Because the region is flat and had water supplies like the mtkvari river close by, it makes a perfect environment for farmlands. With big open areas for agriculture, the population is probably spread out rather concentrated as a city would be. 
### How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of transportation facilities?
They aren’t any challenging natural borders for infrastructure to be hindered so I would assume that transportation wouldn’t be such an issue. From my plotting of primary and secondary roads, it’s clear that they all connect to those greater urban areas in some manner. 
### How has topography appeared to have impacted the location of health care facilities?
After trying two different data sources, I was only able to have one health care facility, a hospital, plotted on my graph. After a quick google search, I found that there are many more hospitals just in the city alone. However, the one hospital I could plot is on a seconday road.  
#### Has producing your three-dimensional map resulted in an interpretation that is different from your previous analysis?
Not necessarily, no.
