## Political Districts and Subdivisions of Azerbaijan

In total, there are ten administrative subdivisions of Azerbaijan: Absheron, Ganja-Qazakh, Shaki-Zaqatala, Lankaran, Guba-Khachmaz, Aran, Yukhari-Karabakh, Kalbajar-Lachin, Mountainous Shirvan, and Nakhchivan. The largest of them all in terms of surface area (km²) near the center of the country, Aran, has a total population of 1,893,036. The smallest out of all the adms is Absherson, where the capital city of Baku is located. Although the smallest in surface area, it has the highest population of the country with 2,613,300 people. Interestingly, the district of Nakhchivan is not geographically attached to the rest of Azerbaijan’s main divisions. It is an exclave that borders Armenia to the east and north, Iran to the south and west, and a tiny sliver of Turkey to the northwest.

In the plot above, the names of the ten districts are in a larger font. In the gray-outlined areas, there are the name of the seventy-eight subdivisions of each district. The spatial plot below depicts the population density across each subdivision in Azerbaijan. As indicated by the bright red, the subdistrict where Baku is located has the highest population density. The second highest is the subdistrict right next to it. This most likely means that many people will live outside of the city, whether it be for a lower cost of living or something like that, and commute into the capital for work.

## Population of Azerbaijan

As mentioned above, the Absheron district has the largest population of 2,613,300, and Baku city itself has 2,236,000 people. The lowest population is in the Kalbajar-Lachin district with only 231,300 people over 6,4000 km². The histogram plot listed below depicts the population density in Azerbaijan in 2019.

The plot below is a residual model that contains data of nighttime lights, urban cover, and bare cover as independent variables and pop19 as the dependent variable.

Getting a closer look at Baku city, the graphs below show some margins of errors when predicting the population density. Below is a subsetted margin or error map of Baku city, where the only margin of error was located throughout the whole country. The green indicated 0 errors while the redder the map gets, the higher amount of predictability error.

## Roads and Health Care Facilities Across Azerbaijan

In the plot below, all of Azerbaijan is shown with primary roads in blue, secondary roads in green, and unknown roads in orange.

The plot below has all health care facilities across Azerbaijan. Hospitals, clinics, and doctors are represented as red crosses while pharmacies are represented as red upsidedown triangles. Dentists are represented by a regular diamond polygon and are in the color blue. From the graph, the majority of healthcare facilities are in or near Baku, where the majority of the Azerbaijani population lives. However, the rest of the country is lacking in healthcare facilities with only a few scattered about per district. The district with the smallest population (Kalbajar-Lachin) has zero. After some further research, this is a clear discrepancy in the data from HDx.

Below is a combined plot of the roads and health care facilities (all in red).

Moving more towards the rural regions of Azerbaijan, I chose to investigate the subdivision of Barda in the Aran district. Barda has a total population of 154,812 and is mostly flat farmland. Pictured below is a population density graph of the region of Barda.

The map below has many black points that each represent one person. Therefore, it is easy to interpret where the more urban areas are located.

Returning to the Barda subdivision, the plot below has primary roads in blue, and secondary roads in green. There is only one health care facility, a hospital, in the region that is near the southern border represented by a magenta cross. As previously mentioned, there are many other health care facilities in the Barda region but because of data issues, there is only one. I checked multiple sources to retrieve data for health care facilities, but ultimately this was the result. Additionally, there are urban areas that are being emphasized by dots that range from red to yellow (red being the highest population).

Finally, below is a three-dimensional topographic map of Barda with roads, health care facilities (or lack thereof), and urban areas. The border is outlined in red dashed lines, the primary roads are blue, and the secondary roads are light cyan. The urban areas are faint, but they are a golden color with a lowered opacity to see the geography of the terrain. Barda is a falt valley-like area that is primarily used for farming. It is close to the mtkvari river that begins in Georgia and then spans all of Azerbaijan to end in the Caspian Sea. The river is visible near the corner closest to the viewer with a secondary road that crosses it. Omitting the absence of health care facilities, the state of human development in the region is adequate for the most part. There are roads that lead to urban areas and are further connected to the rest of the country. Since the majority of the area is used for agricultural purposes, there isn’t much need for lots of infrastructures.
