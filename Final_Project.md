## Political Districts and Subdivisions of Azerbaijan

In total, there are ten administrative subdivisions of Azerbaijan: Absheron, Ganja-Qazakh, Shaki-Zaqatala, Lankaran, Guba-Khachmaz, Aran, Yukhari-Karabakh, Kalbajar-Lachin, Mountainous Shirvan, and Nakhchivan. The largest of them all in terms of surface area (km²) near the center of the country, Aran, has a total population of 1,893,036. The smallest out of all the adms is Absherson, where the capital city of Baku is located. Although the smallest in surface area, it has the highest population of the country with 2,613,300 people. Interestingly, the district of Nakhchivan is not geographically attached to the rest of Azerbaijan’s main divisions. It is an exclave that borders Armenia to the east and north, Iran to the south and west, and a tiny sliver of Turkey to the northwest.

In the plot above, the names of the ten districts are in a larger font. In the gray-outlined areas, there are the name of the seventy-eight subdivisions of each district. The spatial plot below depicts the population density across each subdivision in Azerbaijan. As indicated by the bright red, the subdistrict where Baku is located has the highest population density. The second highest is the subdistrict right next to it. This most likely means that many people will live outside of the city, whether it be for a lower cost of living or something like that, and commute into the capital for work.

## Population of Azerbaijan

As mentioned above, the Absheron district has the largest population of 2,613,300, and Baku city itself has 2,236,000 people. The lowest population is in the Kalbajar-Lachin district with only 231,300 people over 6,4000 km². The histogram plot listed below depicts the population density in Azerbaijan in 2019.

The plot below is a residual model that contains data of nighttime lights, urban cover, and bare cover as independent variables and pop19 as the dependent variable.

Getting a closer look at Baku city, the graphs below show some margins of errors when predicting the population density. Below is a subsetted margin or error map of Baku city, where the only margin of error was located throughout the whole country. The green indicated 0 errors while the redder the map gets, the higher amount of predictability error.
