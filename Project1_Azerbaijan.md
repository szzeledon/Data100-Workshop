## Administrative Subdivisions

The plot above depicts the many subdivisions of Azerbaijan, a small, densely populated country caught between the border of the Middle East and Eastern Europe. As the gradient above explains, the majority of the population lives in, or near the capital city of Baku. The numbers below the names of the districts are the different population densities. Creating the plot took a lot of patience and refining. After many attempts and struggles, including forgetting to provide R with a working directory that resulted in having to start the whole process over again, I was able to formulate a semi-legible map of Azerbaijan. 

## Bar Graph of District Density and Administrative Subdivisions

The bar graph above was no simple task for me. I made it through about half of the instructions when the bar graph became noncooperative to the commands I was sending R. The major complication was that my data was split between an adm1 and an adm2 and thus would over complicate my data (pictured below).

Regardless of the countless twists and turns encountered along the way, I enjoyed my time learning about the geographic population of Azerbaijan, and using R to create plots that presented a refined and easy to read version of population data. This process was similar to figuring out a puzzle, and results in a very satisfying product. If I were to do this project over again, I would focus on a country with only one adm1 and possibly take the time to explore the more qualitative parts of the project, like the stretch goals.
