## Administrative Subdivisions

The plot above depicts the many subdivisions of Azerbaijan, a small, densely populated country caught between the border of the Middle East and Eastern Europe. As the gradient above explains, the majority of the population lives in, or near the capital city of Baku. The numbers below the names of the districts are the different population densities. Creating the plot took a lot of patience and refining. After many attempts and struggles, including forgetting to provide R with a working directory that resulted in having to start the whole process over again, I was able to formulate a semi-legible map of Azerbaijan.
